# Web Traffic Forecasting

This project aims to predict web traffic for the next hour using historical data, helping in dynamic resource management for websites. The model is built using a deep learning approach, specifically leveraging time series data to forecast future web traffic.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Keras

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:



### requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python libraries that your project depends on. You can generate this file by listing each dependency along with its version. Here's an example based on your script:

```
pandas>=1.1.5
numpy>=1.19.5
matplotlib>=3.3.4
scikit-learn>=0.24.1
keras>=2.4.3
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Usage

This project is structured as a Jupyter notebook which guides you through:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Preparing the data for training
- Building and training the deep learning model
- Evaluating the model performance
- Forecasting future web traffic
